•	Designed and simulated a compact, linearly polarized dual-band microstrip patch antenna targeting Wi-Fi bands (2.4–2.5 GHz, 5.1–5.9 GHz), meeting |S₁₁| ≤ -10 dB and ≥6 dBi gain requirements.
•	Utilized Ansys Electronics Desktop (HFSS) to optimize geometry, feed structure, and impedance matching within a 100 mm × 100 mm × 50 mm form factor.
•	Achieved radiation pattern analysis, gain plots, and bandwidth validation through 3D EM simulations; validated linear polarization and dual-band performance through full-wave analysis.
